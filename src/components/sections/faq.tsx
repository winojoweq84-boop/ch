      id: 'item-1',
      question: 'How quickly can I sell my car?',
      answer: 'With CarVault, you can sell your car in as little as 2 hours! Our process includes instant online valuation, same-day inspection, and immediate payment in crypto or cash. Most transactions are completed within 24 hours.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-2',
      question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
      answer: 'We accept crypto payments in USDT and USDC only. These stablecoins provide the best rates and instant settlement to your wallet. All payments are processed immediately upon completion of the sale.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-3',
      question: 'Do you buy cars in any condition?',
      answer: 'Yes! We buy cars in any condition - from brand new to heavily damaged. Whether your car is running perfectly or needs major repairs, we provide fair valuations based on current market value and condition.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-4',
      question: 'How accurate is your online valuation?',
      answer: 'Our online valuation is highly accurate and based on real-time market data, your car\'s specifications, and current UAE market conditions. The final price is confirmed after our quick inspection, but typically matches our online estimate within 5-10%.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-5',
      question: 'What paperwork is required?',
      answer: 'We handle all the paperwork for you! You just need your Emirates ID, car registration (mulkiya), and any service records. Our team takes care of the transfer process, insurance cancellation, and all necessary documentation.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-6',
      question: 'Do you offer better prices than dealerships?',
      answer: 'Yes! We typically offer 15-20% more than traditional dealerships because we have lower overhead costs and work directly with buyers. Our transparent pricing ensures you get the best market value for your vehicle.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-7',
      question: 'Is there a fee for the service?',
      answer: 'No hidden fees! Our service is completely free for sellers. We make money by selling your car to our network of buyers, so you keep 100% of the agreed price. The only fees are standard government transfer fees.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-8',
      question: 'Can I sell my car if I still have a loan?',
      answer: 'Absolutely! We work with banks and finance companies to settle outstanding loans. We can pay off your remaining balance directly to the bank and give you the difference, or help you understand your options if you owe more than the car\'s value.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-9',
      question: 'What is USDT and why do you use it?',
      answer: 'USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning 1 USDT = $1 USD. It\'s widely accepted, has low transaction fees, and provides instant transfers. We use USDT because it offers better rates than traditional banking and eliminates currency conversion fees.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-10',
      question: 'What is USDC and how does it work?',
      answer: 'USDC (USD Coin) is another stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, similar to USDT but issued by Circle. It\'s fully regulated, transparent, and widely trusted. USDC offers the same benefits as USDT with instant settlement and better rates than traditional payment methods.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-11',
      question: 'How do I receive my crypto payment?',
      answer: 'Simply provide your wallet address for USDT or USDC when completing the sale. We\'ll send the payment directly to your wallet within minutes of finalizing the transaction. You can use any compatible wallet like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or exchange wallets.',
    },
    {
      id: 'item-12',
      question: 'Are crypto payments safe and legal?',
      answer: 'Yes! Crypto payments are completely legal in the UAE and offer enhanced security through blockchain technology. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and protection. We only use established stablecoins (USDT/USDC) to minimize volatility.',
